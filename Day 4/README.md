# Day 4
Today, we learned about Numpy and regression.

### Things To Do:

- Follow the instructions given in the page for previous days, if you haven't already.

- Go through the pdfs uploaded for scikit and matplotlib above.

- Do the homework assignment given:

  > Find a Dataset oniline or generate a sample dataset for one variable and create a Linear Regression model using the techniques discussed. Train the model using 60% of the data and find the accuracy for rest 40% data

- If    `sklearn.datasets.samples_generator.make_regression`  is not working,  you can use `sklean.datasets.make_regression`

  `from sklearn.datasets import make_regression`
