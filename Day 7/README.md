# Day 7
Today, we learned about Logistic Regression

### Things To Do:

- Follow the instructions given in the page for previous days, if you haven't already.

- All the code we did today is uploaded in the jupyter notebook above

- Assignment:

  > Create a Linear Regression Model with one variable, then with two variables for a dataset. Then do it again for Polynomial Model with one variable and two variables. (upto degree 3)
  >
  > 1. Compare the efficiency of the Linear Model and the Polynomial Model for both the cases. 
  >
  > 2. The code should be submitted in a jupyter notebook along with the dataset in a .zip file. 
  > 3. zip file should be like this : <your_name>.zip
  > 4. The jupyter notebook should have plots that show the relationship between target variable and feature variables. You should also have plots for regression curve and any other curve you think will be helpful.
  > 5. The code should be well commented and clean
  > 6. Last date of submission is 03-06-2019 (3rd June, 2019) 
  > 7. Link for submission will be put up shortly.
  > 8. If you cannot find a dataset on your own, you can use [this](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009) dataset.
