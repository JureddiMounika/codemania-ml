# Day 5
Today, we learned about Linear and Polynomial Regression

### Things To Do:

- Follow the instructions given in the page for previous days, if you haven't already.
- I have uploaded a chapter on Regression from a book I really like. While we have not covered everything that is given in the file regression.pdf above, we have covered most of the things. 
- Let me know if you like it and want me to upload the whole book.
