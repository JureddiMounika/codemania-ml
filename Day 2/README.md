# Day 2
Today, we learned about Numpy and regression.

### Things To Do:

- Follow the instructions given in the page for Day 1, if you haven't already.
- Play around with the NumPy library. Go through the file uploaded [above](https://github.com/paravsingla/codemania-ml/blob/master/Day%202/numpy.pdf)
- Problems for NumPy will be uploaded soon. You can take a few days to solve them.
- Read more about regression online. You can go through the wikipedia page or search for other explanations elsewhere.
